## What it does

Draws the hunger details that AppleSkin shows over the food bar:

- **Saturation icons**: how much saturation you have, shown as food icons over the food bar.
- **Exhaustion strip**: a thin bar showing how close you are to the next point of food loss.
- **Held food preview**: the food in your hand, with how much food and saturation it restores.
- **Animation**: fade in, pulse, or both (default).

Each part can be switched on or off, and the animation can be changed, in the native mod settings.

## Build

```sh
horizon-launcher native-build . --trust-native-code
